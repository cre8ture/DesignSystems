Our hope in this design system is to reflect our values. Our values are:
1) Celebrate the unique, neuro-diverse learners we work with and offer them an experience of joyful learning
2) Approach learning challenges witha mult--discplinary lens that centers the learner's unique interests at the forefront of our approach
3) Enagage in a 'whole-child' philosophy 

## Design System Philosophy

The aim of the design system was to take thebodyliterate.com's original concepts that involved using a graph based visual language to describe our concepts and to rework them using the Material Design System. We wanted to ensure the site took into account accessibility features, as well as best practices in design. To this end, we have built up this documentation to reflect these decisions.
